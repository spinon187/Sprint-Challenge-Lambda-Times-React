1. PropTypes is pre-emptive debugging used to check whether or not the types of data in your component's state properties are the types you intend, ie you are not attempting to pass a number to a property designed to hold a string, or an array to one meant for a boolean.

2. Life-cycle events trigger based on conditions that occur relative to the mounting of a component. For instance, a componentWillMount function occurs right before the component is rendered and allows it to make changes to accomodate itself, and componentWillUnmount allows a component that's no longer being used to clean up after itself when it's done rather than leaving leftover code still running.

3. Higher order components are components that takes other components in as parameters and produces new components whose specifics are contingent on the components it recieved.

4. You can style in vanilla CSS and import within the component itself, which is simple and unlikely to create dependency issues. You can also use a preprocessor, which confers all the standard advantages of preprocessing, automation/nesting/etc. You can also use styled components, which allows you to significantly pare down your file structure and write your CSS within the component's javascript itself.
